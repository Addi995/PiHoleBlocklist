# Title: Smart-TV Blocklist for Pi-hole
# Version: 15December2021v1
# Description: This is a blocklist to block smart-TVs sending metadata back home, sometimes with the added benefit of blocking interface ads for apps and movie services.
# Please help with collecting domains!
# It could occur that the TV fails to receive new updates, or that other apps or services no longer work. Please report such an incident.
# Make sure to also use the extra RegEx list at https://perflyst.github.io/PiHoleBlocklist/regex.list, which helps remove regional LG ad domains among other things.
